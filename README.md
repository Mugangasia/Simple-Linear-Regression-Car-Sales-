# Simple-Linear-Regression-Car-Sales-


In this exercise we will use a larger dataset that has both more datapoints and more independent variables. The dataset contains data on various car models and here we want to predict the car price from its features. We will only use one of these variables for now and will come back to use more variables in the next chapter where we look at multiple linear regression. We will also split our data into a training set and test set so we can apply our model to unseen data.
